**NOTE: The title of y-axis of Fig. 2 (Log10-transformed HC5 (μg/L)) is not accurate. The accurate title of y-axis is "HC5 (μg/L: log-scale)".**

**NOTE: The parameters in Table 1 result in SSDs expressed in µg/mL on a log10 scale. Please be aware that these values are not in µg/L.**

## Data
Data_SSDmodeling_ToMEx2022_v1.xlsx

The "Data" sheet contains the data used for the analysis, and the "Notes_rows_names" sheet provides additional notes related to the "Data" sheet.

## R Code
Before getting started, please ensure that you have installed "RStan." For instructions, refer to the webpage at: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started.

Running Bayesian SSD models using the R package “rstan” can be challenging due to compatibility issues with different versions of R and related R packages. 

For your information, we have run the SSD models using the following configurations:
- R version 3.6.3
- R package "rstan" version 2.21.2
- R package "loo" version 2.5.1

To proceed, please refer to the R code file "SSDmodeling_Fullmodel_v1.r" for further instructions and implementation details.


Please contact Yuichi Iwasaki at yuichi-iwasaki (at) aist.go.jp or yuichiwsk (at) gmail.com if you have any queries and questions.
